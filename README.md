# C Command Line Fun
I was bored and wanted to brush up my C skills a little bit so I made a quick little command line tic-tac-toe game. I'm thinking about adding another couple little C command line tools like maybe a todolist and calculator thing. Just fun stuff to get some opportunities to dink around with C.
